Dr. Teperman \\ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \\nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \\nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \\ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \\na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \\nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \\nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \\nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \\nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \\ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \\nDr. Teperman. \\n\\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\\n\\n\\nLAST MEETING\\n\\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \\nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \\nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \\nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \\nslate for the Board.\\n\\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\\n\\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\\n\\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\\n\\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \\nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \\nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \\nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \\nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \\nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \\n\\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \\nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \\na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \\naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \\nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \\nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\\n\\nDR.

       "  'From: banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu\\nSubject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation\\nLines: 154\\nNntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu\\nOrganization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n\\nI got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\\n\\n\\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \\ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \\ninteraction\"J.

Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\\n\\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \\nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \\nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \\nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \\npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me.

       "  'From: jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com (rathmann,janice e)\\nSubject: Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy)\\nOrganization: Bellcore, Livingston, NJ\\nSummary: Headaches and analgesics\\nLines: 95\\n\\n\\nI noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\\nI generally don\\'t take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I\\'ve\\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I\\'ve tried Synarel, it reduced\\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don\\'t expect to have\\nany more children, I don\\'t like the idea of having my uterus and\\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\\nto have children.  So basically all I\\'m left with is toughing out\\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn\\'t work, and Motrin gave me\\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I\\'m through with it).  In\\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \\nlegs) as I\\'ll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it\\'s actually quite effective\\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\\nI\\'m frequently in severe pain.\\n\\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I\\'ve had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\\n(I\\'ve had 2 of them, and don\\'t intend to ever do that again) with\\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I\\'d \\nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don\\'t have\\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\\n\\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can\\'t avoid them entirely because\\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\\nbut I\\'m avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\\na reduced capacity (I\\'m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can\\'t concentrate much,\\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\\nI can\\'t really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\\nI\\'ve taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\\nI reduced the dosage), but I don\\'t like the side effects (if I take\\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn\\'t very helpful when\\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I\\'ve tried several other medications\\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\\nthey either didn\\'t work, or I couldn\\'t tolerate them.  So what can I do?\\nMy doctor\\'s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\\npain.  I\\'ve had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\\nsuccinylcholine), and I\\'ve already had surgery several times.\\n\\nAnyway, the point of what I\\'m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\\n\\nJanice Rathmann\\n\\n',\n",

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n        2. X terminals\\n        3. NeXT\\n        4. Silicon Graphics\\n        5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\t6. Other stuff\\n\\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\\n\\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\\n\\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\\n\\n    3. NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6. Other stuff\\n\\n\\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\\n\\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\\n\\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\\n\\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\\n\\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\\n\\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\\n\\n\\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\\n    Sales offices all over the place.\\n\\n    Availability: February, 1993\\n    Price: $219\\n    Supports: Mac only\\n\\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\\n\\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\\n\\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\\n\\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I\\'ll have a detailed blurb from\\n    TidBITS available there.\\n\\n\\nFlexPro Keyboard\\n    Key Tronic\\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\\n\\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\\n    Price: $489 (?)\\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\\n\\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \\n\\n My questions are: \\n\\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\\n     levels of pain?\\n\\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\\n\\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\\n\\n\\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\\n  \\n  \\n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\\n\\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\\n   \\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nGregory W.

The thing is, in order to\\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in.

I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n\\n',\n",

What was the methodology of Darwin?  What\\nwas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the\\nmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  \\n\\n\\nIn an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:  \\n\\n>None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should\\n>open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.\\n>Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional\\n>Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most\\n>part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research\\n>Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does\\n>*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*\\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\\n>which are not.)\\n\\nFirst of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I\\ndon\\'t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,\\nhomeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be\\naccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of\\nhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  \\n\\nWhat some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things\\n(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific\\nattention.  \\n\\nIf in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not\\nuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is\\neffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all\\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \\n\\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \\nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \\nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \\n\\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one\\'s attitude as\\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\\nreason.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \\nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \\ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \\nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \\nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \\npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \\nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \\nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \\nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \\nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins.

This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \\ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \\npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \\nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \\nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \\'cooties\\' that \\nhaven\\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \\non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \\n\\nOf course in TCM...the body\\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \\nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \\nsite.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \\ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \\nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \\n\\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\\n                                                                                                    \\n  \\n',\n",

       "  'From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\\nSubject: ST1100 ride\\nKeywords: heavy\\nLines: 95\\n\\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \\nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\\n\\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\\na big moto party.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \\nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \\nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\\nbicycle!  \\'It cant be that heavy\\' I thought.\\n\\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \\nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \\ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\\n\\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \\ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \\nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\\n\\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \\nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \\nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\\nbuzz.\\n\\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \\nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \\nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\\n\\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\\'s wrist, our singal\\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \\nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \\nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \\nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\\n\\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \\nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \\nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\\n\\n\\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I\\'d buy on for about $3000 less than \\nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\\n-- \\n\\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \\t\\t\\t\\tXyvision Color Systems\\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\\t\\t101 Edgewater Drive\\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\\t\\t\\t\\tWakefield MA\\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\\t\\t018801285\\n',\n",

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\\ncheap.  \\n\\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.

My definition\\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\\nwork.  Lee Lady writes:\\n\\n> I don\\'t think that science should be defined in a way that some \\n> of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely\\n> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as\\n> scientific work.  \\n\\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\\nmistake, they fall under my definition.

It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\n> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\n> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\n> treatment.

As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\\n\\n> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\n> make this simple test.

When\\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\\nresearchers\\' minds.  \\n\\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\\ndirections for research.

In my field,\\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\\neases one\\'s defense.)\\n\\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

What frequency is used for\\n>the land-based beacons?\\n\\n>Thanks in advance,\\n\\n>Charlie Thompson\\n>.\\n\\nHere\\'s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

Multiple graphs (of the same or\\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\\n+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\\n+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\\n+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\\n+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\\n+  \\n+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\\n+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\\n+  \\n+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n+  \\n+  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\\n+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\\n+  \\n+  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\\n==========================================================\\n\\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\\n======================\\n\\nIMDISP\\n------\\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\\n  [PC and Macs]\\n\\nLabVIEW 2\\n---------\\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been\\n  developed by Spyglass.\\n\\n  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000\\n  fax: 217 355 8925\\n\\nNIH IMAGE\\n---------\\n  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)\\n  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.\\n  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,\\n  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting\\n  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\\n\\nPhotoMac\\n--------\\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\\n\\nPhotoPress\\n----------\\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\\n\\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\\n------------------------\\n  \"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It is easily\\n  extensible through \"script\" (or indirect command) files. These script\\n  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are\\n  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.\\n  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame\\n  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides\\n  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\"\\n\\n  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200\\n\\nSatellite Image Workshop\\n------------------------\\n  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all\\n  sorts of image enhancing on it. You\\'ll need at least a Mac II with co-\\n  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\\'t\\n  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1\\n\\n  In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet\\n  Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109\\n  (818) 354-6980\\n\\nVisualization Workbench\\n-----------------------\\n  \"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image\\n  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\"\\n\\n  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112\\n\\nAdobe Photoshop\\n---------------\\n\\n  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey\\n  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\\n\\nDigital Darkroom\\n----------------\\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\\n\\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Today he\\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\\nI'd never seen before.\\n\\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\\n\\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\\n\\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\\n\\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\\nand concerns me are:\\n\\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\\n\\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\\n\\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\\n    so.\\n\\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\\n\\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\\n\\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\\n\\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\\n\\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal\\nbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!\\n\",\n",

That you\\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \\nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \\nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\\n\\nA recent movie, Lorenzo\\'s Oil, offers a perfect example of what\\nI\\'m talking about.  If you haven\\'t seen it, you should.  It\\'s not\\na put down of doctor\\'s and neither is what I\\'m saying.  Doctors are\\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That\\'s because \\nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \\ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\\nfind your way out of it.\\n\\n\\nI have chosen the latter.\\n\\n\\nLinda\\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com\\n\\n\\n>\\n>-- \\n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\\n>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \\n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

       "  'From: renew@blade.stack.urc.tue.nl (Rene Walter)\\nSubject: CView answers\\nOrganization: MCGV Stack, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands.\\nLines: 66\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: blade.stack.urc.tue.nl\\nSummary: some CView problems explained\\nKeywords: Stupid Programming\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\\n\\nA very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n\\n\\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\\'t we all just live together       |\\n |  I don\\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n\\n',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\\n\\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\\'s ONLY if you restrict\\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\\nsecond derivative.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\\n\\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\\na wonderful report by New Zealand\\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!  I\\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\\'d\\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\\'d love somebody to edit the\\nabove sections, looking for places where I\\'ve obviously goofed.\\n\\n==6== References\\n\\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

The critique comes from THE TUFTS\\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\\n\\n\\t\"Chances are good that if you watched \\'60 Minutes\\' last November\\n\\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\\n\\tthe segment entitled \\'No MSG,\\' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\\n\\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\\n\\t(\\'millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\\n\\tsick\\'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\\n\\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\\n\\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \\n\\tthose studies are.\\n\\n\\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\\n\\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\\n\\tto back up his comment that there is \\'a lot of evidence\\' that MSG,\\n\\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\\n\\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\\n\\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\\n\\thumans but on rabbits.\\n\\n\\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\\n\\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\\n\\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \\n\\theadaches from it.  \\'But,\\' she explains, \\'the show probably \\n\\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\\'\\n\\n\\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\\n\\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\\n\\tremarks, \\'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\\n\\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters\\' because\\n\\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney\\'s\\n\\tresearch with lab animals does not \\'show\\' anything about human\\n\\tyoungsters.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney\\'s \\n\\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\\n\\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \\n\\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\\n\\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\\n\\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\\n\\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \\n\\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\\n\\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\\n\\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\\n\\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\\n\\tfound in Dr. Olney\\'s lab animals.....\\n\\n\\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\\n\\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities\\' Scientific\\n\\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\\n\\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\\n\\n\\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\\n\\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\\n\\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\\n\\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\\n\\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\\n\\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\\n\\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\\n\\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\\n\\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\\n\\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\\n\\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\\n\\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\\n\\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\\n\\n\\tThat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s entirely unimaginable that a small number\\n\\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\\n\\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\\n\\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\\n\\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n',\n",

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\\n\\n\\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\\n (depending on the topic). \\n\\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\\n       list directly.\\n \\n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\\n \\n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\\n ----------------------------------\\n\\n It is possible to receive the list in \\'digest\\'ed form (ie. a\\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \\n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\\n day.\\n\\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \\n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\\n\\n\\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\\n -----------------------\\n\\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\\n\\n\\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\\n (though this isn\\'t necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\\n based mail systems). \\n\\n BOUNCES\\n -------\\n\\n Because I haven\\'t had the time (or the inclination to replace\\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

The reason is\\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\\n\\nI\\'ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\\n\\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\\n   water.\\n\\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\\n\\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\\n\\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\\nthe victim\\'s urine is strangely dense.

Effectively\\n\\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\\n\\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\\n\\n74H\\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\\n\\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\\n\\n74L\\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\\n\\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\\n\\n74S\\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\\n\\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\\n\\n74LS\\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\\n\\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\\n\\tdevices.\\n\\n74F\\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\\n\\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\\n\\n74AS\\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\\n\\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\\n\\n74ALS\\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\\n\\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\\n\\n74C\\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\\n\\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\\n\\tCMOS 74 families.\\n\\n4000\\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\\n\\tclear choice when speed is not important.\\n\\n74HC\\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\\n\\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\\n\\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\\n\\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\\n\\n10K\\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\\n\\tthe rules or it won\\'t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\\n\\tcan be expensive.\\n\\n100K\\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\\ninteresting but I haven\\'t used either significantly yet.\\n-- \\nAll work is one man\\'s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\\n',\n",

(BTW, as of a\\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\\nGSX\\'s and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren\\'t ripped off is that\\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \\nthem honest about acquiring parts. \\n\\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you\\'ve got 2 different situations. There is a\\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\\nnot as high, comparatively. For the \\'rockets\\', anytime a bike goes down, the \\nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It\\'s fairly easy,\\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\\n\\nMike\\n-- \\nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel \"Hey, what does Stop L1A d...\"\\n',\n",

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC\\'s are highly\\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\\n\\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA.

My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

If\\n\\tyou\\'re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\\'t\\n\\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\\n\\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\\n\\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\\n\\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\\n\\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\\n\\twith the electrical code, but we don\\'t quote sections\\n\\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\\'re wrong,\\n\\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\\n\\n\\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\\n\\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\\n\\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\\n\\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\\n\\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\\n\\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\\n\\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\\n\\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\\n\\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\\n\\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\\n\\trules.\\n\\n\\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\\n\\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\\n\\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\\n\\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\\n\\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\\n\\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\\'ve\\n\\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\\'\\' or\\n\\t``CEC\\'\\'.\\n\\n\\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\\n\\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\\n\\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\\n\\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\\n\\tIt\\'s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\\n\\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\\n\\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\\'s the\\n\\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\\'s an abridged\\n\\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\\n\\tAnd there\\'s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\\n\\tcommentary\\'\\' on the code, as well as the full text.  That\\'s the\\n\\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\\'s no handbook for\\n\\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\\n\\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\\n\\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\\n\\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\\n\\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\\n\\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\\n\\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\\n\\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\\n\\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\\n\\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\\n\\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\\n\\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\\n\\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\\n\\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\\n\\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\\n\\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\\n\\n\\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\\n\\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\\n\\tOntario, it\\'s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\\'t\\n\\toverly fat.  It\\'s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\\n\\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\\n\\tequivalent NEC publications.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\\n\\tthe province.\\n\\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\\n\\n\\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\\n\\tIn some, they\\'re not.  Check with your local electrical\\n\\tinspector.  Most places won\\'t permit you to do wiring on other\\'s\\n\\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\\n\\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\\n\\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\\n\\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\\n\\twiring if you\\'re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\\n\\tfind one willing to supervise.\\n\\n\\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\\n\\n\\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\\n\\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\\'s your own home,\\n\\tand it\\'s you or your family that might get killed if you make\\n\\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\\n\\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\\n\\tIn this FAQ we\\'ve consciously given a few recommendations that\\n\\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\\'s reasonable,\\n\\tand will impress the inspector.\\n\\n\\tThe inspector will know that you\\'re an amateur.  You have to\\n\\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\\n\\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\\'t cut corners.\\n\\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\\n\\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t try to hide anything from the inspector.\\n\\n\\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\\'t use a bread knife to strip\\n\\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\\n\\twon\\'t like it, and the results won\\'t be that safe.  And it\\n\\ttakes longer.  And you\\'re more likely to stick a hunk of\\n\\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t handle house wire when it\\'s very cold (eg: below -10C\\n\\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\\n\\tbecome very brittle.\\n\\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\\n\\n\\tFirst, there\\'s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\\n\\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\\'re \\n\\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\\n\\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\\n\\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\\n\\n\\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\\n\\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you\\'re doing a lot, or\\n\\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\\n\\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\\n\\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\\n\\tyou through, so they\\'re much faster and less fatiguing, even\\n\\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\\n\\n\\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\\n\\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\\n\\twork well).\\n\\t\\n\\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\\n\\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\\'t buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\\n\\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\\n\\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\\n\\tstripping holes, and won\\'t nick or grab the wire - it should\\n\\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\\n\\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\\n\\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\\'t\\n\\tnecessary, and pros usually don\\'t use them.\\n\\n\\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\\n\\tin constricted places.  Don\\'t use these for stripping wire.\\n\\n\\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\\n\\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\\'s better to form wire\\n\\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\\n\\taccurate.\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\\n\\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\\n\\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\\n\\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\\n\\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\\'t try to strip\\n\\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\\'s too easy to\\n\\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\\n\\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\\n\\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\\n\\tthat you\\'ll gouge the conductors.\\n\\n\\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\\'s well\\n\\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\\n\\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\\n\\tor the insulation.\\n\\n\\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\\n\\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\\n\\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\\n\\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\\n\\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\\n\\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\\n\\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\\n\\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\\n\\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\\'ve been known\\n\\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\\n\\n\\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\\n\\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\\n\\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\\n\\n\\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\\n\\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\\n\\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \\n\\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\\n\\tscrews - I don\\'t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\\n\\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\\n\\tthat has no cover plate).\\n\\nSubject: What is UL listing?\\n\\n\\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\\n\\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\\n\\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\\n\\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\\n\\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\\n\\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\\'t necessarily\\n\\tmean that the device actually does what it\\'s supposed to, just\\n\\tthat it probably won\\'t kill you.\\n\\n\\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\\n\\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\\n\\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\\n\\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\\n\\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\\n\\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\\n\\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\\n\\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\\n\\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\\n\\toccupancy permits issued.\\n\\t\\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\\n\\n\\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\\n\\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\\n\\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\\n\\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\\n\\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\\n\\trequired by law.\\n\\n\\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\\n\\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\\n\\tclaim.\\n\\n\\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\\n\\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\\n\\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\\n\\tcompanies.\\n\\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\\n\\n\\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\\n\\n\\t    Residential Wiring\\n\\t    by Jeff Markell,\\n\\t    Craftsman Books,\\n\\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\\n\\n\\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\\n\\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\\n\\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\\n\\t    Herbert P.

Knight authors and publishes a book called\\n\\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\\n\\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\\n\\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\\n\\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\\'ers.  It is better to get\\n\\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\\n\\tquestions on the net ;-).\\n\\n\\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\\n\\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\\n\\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\\n\\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\\n\\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\\n\\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\\n\\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\\n\\tor subsequent owners of your home don\\'t get killed or lose\\n\\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\\n\\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\\n\\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\\n\\tthis.\\n\\n\\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\\n\\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\\n\\tclaims.\\n\\n\\tIn general, the process goes like this:\\n\\t\\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\\n\\t\\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\\n\\t\\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\\n\\t\\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\\'re not\\n\\t\\t  sure of.  If you\\'re doing major work, they may impose\\n\\t\\t  special conditions on you, require loading\\n\\t\\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\\n\\t\\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\\n\\t\\t- If you\\'re installing a main panel, you will need to\\n\\t\\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\\n\\t\\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\\n\\t\\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\\n\\t\\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\\n\\t\\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\\n\\t\\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\\n\\t\\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\\n\\t\\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\\n\\t\\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\\n\\nSubject: My house doesn\\'t meet some of these rules and regulations.\\n\\tDo I have to upgrade?\\n\\n\\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\\n\\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\\n\\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\\n\\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\\'\\' work, you\\n\\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\\n\\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\\n\\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\\n\\n\\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\\n\\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\\n\\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\\n\\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\\n\\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\\n\\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\\n\\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\\n\\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\\'s not\\n\\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\\n\\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\\n\\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\\n\\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\\n\\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\\n\\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\\n\\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\\n\\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\\n\\n\\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\\n\\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\\n\\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\\n\\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\\n\\tlow.\\n\\n\\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\\n\\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\\n\\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\\n\\tcircuit that\\'s 277V from hot to neutral.\\n\\n\\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\\n\\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\\n\\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\\n\\n\\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\\n\\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\\n\\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\\n\\n \\tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\\n \\tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\\n \\tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\\n\\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\\n\\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\\n\\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\\n\\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\\n\\tnormally carries no current.\\n\\n\\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\\n\\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\\n\\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\\n\\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\\n\\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\\n\\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\\n\\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\\n\\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\\n\\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\\n\\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\\n\\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\\n\\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\\n\\n\\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\\n\\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\\n\\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\\n\\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \\n\\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\\n\\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\\n\\tinspector.\\n\\n\\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\\n\\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\\n\\twell.\\n\\n\\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\\n\\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\\n\\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\\n\\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\\n\\n\\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\\n\\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\\n\\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\\n\\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\\n\\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\\n\\tservice).\\n\\nSubject: What is a circuit?\\n\\n\\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\\n\\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\\n\\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\\n\\t\\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\\n\\t\\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\\n\\t\\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\\n\\t\\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\\n\\n\\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\\n\\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\\n\\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\\n\\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\\n\\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\\n\\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\\n\\tair conditioners.\\n\\n\\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\\n\\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\\n\\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\\n\\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\\n\\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\\n\\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\\n\\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\\n\\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\\n\\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\\n\\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\\n\\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\\n\\tpermissible.]\\n\\n\\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\\n\\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\\n\\n\\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\\n\\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\\n\\n\\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\\n\\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\\n\\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\\n\\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\\n\\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\\n\\n\\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\\n\\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\\n\\n\\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\\n\\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\\n\\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\\n\\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\\n\\talternative to GFCI protection.\\n\\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\\n\\n\\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\\n\\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\\n\\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\\n\\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\\n\\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\\n\\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\\n\\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\\n\\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\\n\\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\\n\\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\\n\\ttogether in the panel.\\n\\n\\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\\n\\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\\n\\n\\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\\n\\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\\n\\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\\n\\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\\n\\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\\n\\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\\n\\n\\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\\n\\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\\n\\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\\n\\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\\n\\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\\n\\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\\n\\tequipment itself won\\'t cause a fire.\\n\\n\\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\\n\\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\\n\\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\\n\\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\\n\\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\\n\\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\\n\\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\\n\\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\\n\\treplaced.\\n\\n\\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\\n\\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\\n\\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\\n\\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\\n\\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\\n\\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\\n\\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\\n\\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\\n\\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\\n\\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\\n\\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\\n\\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\\n\\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\\n\\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\\n\\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\\n\\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\\n\\tcan often cause severe damage.\\n\\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\\'t I use fuses?\\n\\n\\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\\n\\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\\n\\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\\n\\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\\n\\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\\n\\tpenny\" trick.\\n\\n\\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\\n\\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\\n\\n\\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\\n\\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\\n\\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\\n\\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\\n\\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\\n\\tBreakers don\\'t do this.\\n\\n\\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\\n\\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\\n\\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\\n\\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\\n\\n\\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\\n\\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\\n\\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\\n\\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\\n\\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\\n\\tif you need one.\\n\\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\\n\\n\\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\\n\\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\\n\\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\\n\\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\\n\\t14 gauge, though it\\'s stiffer and harder to work with.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\\n\\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\\n\\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\\'t dissipate\\n\\theat easily:\\n\\n\\t\\tGauge\\t\\tAmps\\n\\t\\t14\\t\\t15\\n\\t\\t12\\t\\t20\\n\\t\\t10\\t\\t30\\n\\t\\t8\\t\\t40\\n\\t\\t6\\t\\t65\\n\\t\\n\\tWe don\\'t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\\n\\ton the application and precise wire type.\\n\\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\\n\\n\\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\\n\\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\\n\\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\\n\\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\\n\\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\\n\\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\\n\\truns.\\n\\n\\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\\n\\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\\n\\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\\n\\tlamps.  Don\\'t try this unless you\\'re certain that your use fits\\n\\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\\n\\twire.\\n\\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\\n\\n\\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\\n\\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\\n\\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\\n\\tremember there\\'s usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\\n\\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\\n\\n\\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\\n\\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\\n\\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\\n\\n\\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\\n\\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\\n\\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\\n\\tused?\\n\\n\\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\\'s used\\n\\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\\n\\tare trade names.  You\\'ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\\n\\n\\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\\n\\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\\n\\n\\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\\'t need to twist the\\n\\twire, do it anyways - it\\'s more mechanically and electrically\\n\\tsecure.\\n\\n\\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\\n\\tthat the wire nut you\\'re using is the correct size for the\\n\\tquantity and sizes of wire you\\'re connecting together.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\\n\\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\\n\\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\\n\\tit\\'s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\\n\\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\\n\\n\\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\\n\\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\\n\\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\\'s usually done because\\n\\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\\n\\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\\n\\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\\n\\n\\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\\'\\'.  It measures\\n\\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\\n\\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\\n\\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\\n\\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\\n\\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\\n\\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\\n\\tthe circuit.\\n\\n\\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\\n\\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\\n\\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\\n\\twouldn\\'t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\\n\\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\\n\\tGFCI happy.\\n\\n\\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\\n\\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\\n\\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\\n\\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\\n\\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\\n\\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\\n\\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\\n\\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\\' of the sink, garages,\\n\\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\\n\\tjust about anywhere else where you\\'re likely to encounter water\\n\\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\\n\\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\\'\\',\\n\\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\\n\\tlaundry appliances.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\\n\\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\\n\\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\\n\\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\\'re near the door to\\n\\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\\n\\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\\n\\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\\n\\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\\n\\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\\n\\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\\n\\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\\n\\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\\n\\nSubject: Where shouldn\\'t I use a GFCI?\\n\\n\\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\\'t pose a\\n\\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\\n\\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\\n\\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\\n\\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\\n\\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\\n\\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\\n\\tGFCI trips are real; if you\\'re getting a lot of trips for no\\n\\tapparent reason, you\\'d be well-advised to check your wiring\\n\\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\\n\\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\\n\\n\\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\\n\\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\\n\\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\\n\\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\\n\\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\\n\\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\\n\\tcircuit\\'\\' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\\n\\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\\'ll need a\\n\\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\\n\\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\\n\\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\\n\\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\\n\\n\\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\\n\\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\\n\\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\\'ll thank yourself for it.\\n\\n\\tIncidentally, if you\\'re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\\n\\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\\'t\\n\\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\\n\\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\\n\\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\\n\\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\\n\\n\\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\\'s a good idea to use the little\\n\\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\\n\\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\\n\\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\\n\\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\\n\\nSubject: What\\'s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\\n\\n\\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\\'t comment on,\\n\\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\\'t turn on without\\n\\ta good ground connection), they\\'re intended to guard against\\n\\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\\n\\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\\'s an\\n\\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\\n\\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\\n\\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\\n\\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\\n\\tyou touch it while you\\'re grounded, you\\'ll get zapped.  Of\\n\\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\\n\\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\\n\\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\\n\\n\\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\\n\\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\\n\\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\\n\\telectrode in a toaster, and you\\'re not grounded, nothing will\\n\\thappen.  If you\\'re slightly grounded, you\\'ll get a small shock;\\n\\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\\n\\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\\'d be the perfect path to\\n\\tground...\\n\\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\\n\\n\\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\\n\\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\\n\\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\\n\\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\\n\\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\\n\\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\\n\\n\\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\\n\\n\\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\\n\\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\\n\\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\\n\\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\\n\\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\\n\\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\\n\\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\\n\\tcircuits\\'\\' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\\n\\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\\n\\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\\n\\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\\n\\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\\n\\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\\n\\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\\n\\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\\' of a sink *must* be\\n\\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\\n\\n\\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\\n\\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\\n\\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\\n\\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\\n\\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\\n\\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\\n\\tconnection fall off doesn\\'t cause the neutral to disconnect\\n\\tfrom downstream outlets.\\n\\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\\n\\n\\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\\n\\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\\n\\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\\n\\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\\n\\n\\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\\n\\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\\n\\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\\n\\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\\n\\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\\n\\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\\n\\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\\n\\n\\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\\n\\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\\n\\tfairly resistant to damage.\\n\\n\\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\\n\\tsheath.\\n\\t\\n\\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\\n\\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\\n\\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\\n\\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\\n\\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\\n\\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\\n\\n\\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\\n\\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\\n\\tbut this is technically illegal.]\\n\\n\\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\\n\\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\\n\\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\\n\\tand CEC):\\n\\n\\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\\n\\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\\n\\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\\n\\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\\n\\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\\n\\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\\n\\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\\n\\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\\n\\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\\n\\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\\n\\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\\n\\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\\n\\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\\n\\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\\n\\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\\' of every box\\n\\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\\'.\\n\\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\\n\\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\\n\\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\\n\\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\\n\\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\\n\\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\\n\\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\\n\\t      in the breach...]\\n\\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\\n\\t      similar finish.\\n\\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\\n\\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\\n\\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\\n\\t      than 1m (39\").\\n\\n\\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\\n\\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\\n\\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\\n\\tthe insulation.\\n\\n\\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\\n\\tsolid wall coverings.\\n\\n\\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\\n\\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\\n\\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\\n\\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\\n\\twire.\\n\\n\\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\\n\\n\\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\\n\\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\\n\\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\\n\\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\\n\\twiring section.]\\n\\n \\tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\\n \\texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\\n \\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\\n\\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\\n\\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\\n\\tis that if there\\'s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\\n\\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\\n\\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\\n\\t\\n \\tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\\n \\texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\\n \\ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\\n\\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\\n\\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\\n\\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\\n\\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you\\'re doing anything\\n\\tthat\\'s the slightest out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\\n\\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\\n\\n\\tCondition\\t\\t\\tType\\tCEC\\tNEC\\n\\n\\tExposed/Concealed dry\\t\\tplastic\\tNMD90\\tNM\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor\\tAC90\\tAC\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTECK90\\n\\n\\tExposed/Concealed damp\\t\\tplastic\\tNMD90\\tNMC\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor\\tACWU90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTECK90\\n\\n\\tExposed/Concealed wet\\t\\tplastic\\tNMWU90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor\\tACWU90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTECK90\\n\\t\\n\\tExposed to weather\\t\\tplastic\\tNMWU\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTW etc.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor\\tTECK90\\n\\t\\n\\tDirect earth burial/\\t\\tplastic\\tNMWU*\\tUF\\n\\tService entrance\\t\\t\\tRWU\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTWU\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor\\tRA90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTECK90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tACWU90\\n\\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\\n\\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\\n\\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\\n\\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\\n\\tboxes don\\'t use metal cable clamps.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\\n\\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\\n\\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\\n\\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\\n\\n\\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\\n\\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\\n\\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\\n\\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\\n\\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\\n\\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\\n\\n\\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\\n\\n\\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\\'re accessible\\n\\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\\n\\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\\n\\tget nasty.\\n\\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\\n\\n\\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\\n\\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\\n\\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\\n\\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\\n\\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\\n\\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\\n\\twiring doesn\\'t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\\n\\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\\n\\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\\n\\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\\n\\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\\n\\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\\n\\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\\n\\n\\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\\n\\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\\n\\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\\n\\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\\n\\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\\n\\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\\n\\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\\n\\tmounted between the joists.\\n\\n\\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\\n\\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\\n\\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\\n\\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\\n\\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\\n\\t8\\'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\\n\\twith plywood) that doesn\\'t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\\'s 8 *feet*\\n\\tlong)\\n\\n\\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\\n\\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\\n\\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\\n\\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\\'\\' might be worthwhile.\\n\\tPresumably, that\\'s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\\'t\\n\\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\\n\\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\\'t get\\n\\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\\n\\tin later.]\\n\\n\\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\\n\\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\\n\\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\\n\\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\\n\\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\\n\\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\\n\\tfor the sensor can vary.\\n\\n\\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\\n\\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\\n\\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\\n\\n\\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\\n\\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\\n\\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\\n\\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\\n\\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\\n\\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\\n\\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\\n\\n\\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\\n\\tand have them come and check out the problem.\\n\\n\\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\\n\\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\\n\\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\\n\\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\\n\\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\\n\\n\\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\\n\\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\\n\\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\\n\\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\\n\\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\\n\\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\\n\\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\\n\\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\\n\\n\\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\\n\\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\\n\\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\\n\\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\\n\\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\\n\\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\\n\\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\\n\\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\\n\\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\\'\\' has an\\n\\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\\n\\n\\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\\n\\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\\n\\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\\n\\n\\tTheoretically, it doesn\\'t make any difference.  However, there\\n\\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\\n\\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\\n\\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\\n\\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\\n\\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\\n\\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\\n\\n\\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\\n\\tthan 50 feet long.\\n\\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\\n\\n\\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\\n\\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\\n\\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\\n\\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\\n\\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\\n\\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\\n\\n\\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\\n\\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\\n\\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\\n\\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\\n\\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\\n\\tWhat they don\\'t mention is that if you kept it in that\\n\\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\\n\\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\\'s drawing far\\n\\tmore current than it can continuously.\\n\\n\\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\\n\\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\\'t find that figure,\\n\\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\\n\\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\\n\\n\\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\\n\\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\\n\\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\\n\\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\\n\\n\\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\\n\\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\\n\\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\\n\\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\\n\\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\\n\\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\\n\\t       it\\'s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\\n\\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\\n\\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\\n\\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\\n\\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\\n\\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\\n\\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\\n\\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\\n\\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\\n\\t       wouldn\\'t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\\n\\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\\n\\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\\'t\\n\\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\\n\\t       on BX cable.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\\n\\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\\n\\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\\n\\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\\n\\tShould the test button work?\\n\\n\\tWe\\'re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\\n\\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\\'s\\n\\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\\n\\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\\n\\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\\n\\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\\'t require\\n\\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\\n\\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\\n\\tif the test button doesn\\'t work, something\\'s broken, and potentially\\n\\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\\n\\n\\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\\n\\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\\n\\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\\n\\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\\n\\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\\n\\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\\n\\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\\n\\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\\n\\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\\n\\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\\n\\tit, and promised to investigate.)\\n\\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\\n\\n\\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\\n\\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\\n\\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\\n\\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\\n\\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\\n\\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\\n\\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\\n\\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\\n\\twhich means you\\'d have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\\n\\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\\n\\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\\n\\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\\n\\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\\n\\tRPM, while you\\'re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\\n\\n\\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\\'s easier to install them in the\\n\\tbeginning, when you don\\'t have to cut into an existing cable.\\n\\tIt\\'s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\\n\\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\\n\\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\\n\\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\\n\\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\\n\\twrong.\\n\\n\\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\\n\\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\\n\\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\\n\\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\\n\\n\\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\\n\\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\\n\\tDon\\'t overload circuits, and don\\'t use extension cords if you\\n\\tcan help it, unless they\\'re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\\n\\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\\n\\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\\'t withstand as much\\n\\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\\n\\n\\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\\n\\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\\n\\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\\n\\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\\n\\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\\'\\'\\n\\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\\n\\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\\n\\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\\n\\t``horsepower-rated\\'\\' switches instead.\\n\\n\\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\\n\\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\\n\\teven if you ``know\\'\\' that you\\'d never use one of your shop\\n\\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\\n\\thave a different idea.\\n\\n\\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\\n\\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\\n\\nSubject: Underground Wiring\\n\\n\\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\\n\\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\\n\\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\\'t use creosoted lumber, it rots\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\\n\\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\\n\\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\\n\\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\\n\\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\\n\\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\\n\\tof course, don\\'t forget the GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\\n\\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\\n\\tyour specific situation.\\n\\n\\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\\n\\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\\n\\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\\n\\n\\tDuring the 1970\\'s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\\n\\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\\n\\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\\n\\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\\n\\tWe recommend, even if you\\'re allowed to, that do not use it for new\\n\\twiring.\\n\\n\\tBut don\\'t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\\n\\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\\n\\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\\n\\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\\n\\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\\n\\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\\n\\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\\n\\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\\n\\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\\n\\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\\n\\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\\n\\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\\n\\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\\'s attached to, and possibly even\\n\\tcause a fire.\\n\\n\\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\\n\\tinto a house built during the 70\\'s, we will cover basic points of\\n\\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\\'re considering purchasing\\n\\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\\n\\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\\n\\tfor the following things:\\n\\n\\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\\n\\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\\n\\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\\n\\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\\n\\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\\n\\n\\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\\n\\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\\n\\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\\n\\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\\n\\t       up each connection.\\n\\n\\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\\n\\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\\n\\n\\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\\n\\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\\n\\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\\n\\n\\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\\n\\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\\n\\t       be repaired.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\\n\\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\\n\\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\\n\\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\\n\\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\\n\\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\\n\\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\\n\\t       you can rent the tool.\\n\\n\\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\\n\\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\\n\\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\\n    \\n\\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\\n\\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\\n\\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\\n\\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\\n\\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\\n\\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\\n\\tYou can do this yourself too.\\n\\nSubject: I\\'m buying a house!  What should I do?\\n\\n\\tCongratulations.  But...  It\\'s generally a good idea to hire\\n\\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\\n\\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\\n\\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\\n\\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\\n\\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\\n\\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s some hints on what to look for:\\n\\n\\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\\n\\t\\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\\n\\t\\t  proper marking.\\n\\t\\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\\n\\t\\t  a GFCI)\\n\\t\\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\\n\\t\\t- Switched neutrals\\n\\t\\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\\n\\n\\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\\n\\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\\n\\t\\t   not properly terminated wiring)\\n\\t\\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\\n\\t\\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\\n\\t\\t  it\\'s *really* convenient ;-)\\n\\t\\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\\n\\t\\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\\n\\t\\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\\n\\t\\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\\n\\t\\t  ceiling\\n\\t\\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\\n\\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\\n\\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\\n\\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \\n\\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\\n\\n\\tThe oldest wiring system you\\'re likely to encounter is called\\n\\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\\n\\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\\n\\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\\n\\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\\n\\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\\n\\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\\n\\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\\n\\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\\n\\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\\n\\tcases K&T isn\\'t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\\n\\tcolour as the hot wires.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'ll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40\\'s.\\n\\n\\tComments on K&T:\\n\\n\\t\\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\\n\\t\\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\\n\\t\\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\\n\\t\\t  very well.  Most K&T I\\'ve seen, for example, is in\\n\\t\\t  quite good condition.\\n\\t\\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\\n\\t\\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\\n\\t\\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\\n\\t\\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\\n\\t\\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\\'t balanced very well between\\n\\t\\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\\n\\t\\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\\n\\t\\t  any circuit.\\n\\t\\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\\n\\t\\t  that contain K&T.\\n\\t\\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\\n\\t\\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\\n\\t\\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\\n\\t\\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\\'t\\n\\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\\'s K&T.  What you should\\n\\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\\n\\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\\'s perfectly\\n\\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\\n\\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\\n\\t\\n\\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\\n\\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\\n\\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\\n\\tused in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\\n\\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\\n\\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\\'ve seen whole\\n\\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\\n\\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\\n\\n\\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\\n\\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\\n\\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\\n\\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\\n\\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\\n\\ttubing.\\n\\n\\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\\n\\tIt\\'s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\\n\\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\\'t present a hazard\\n\\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\\n\\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\\'t abuse it too much.\\n\\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\\n\\n\\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\\n\\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\\n\\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\\n\\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\\n\\tknow what you\\'re talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\\n\\tsales people.  They\\'ll give you much valuable information.\\n-- \\nChris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541\\nPsroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\\nFerret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\\n',\n",

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \\nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \\ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\\'s content.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \\nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my \\'85 FJ1100. They are rated\\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\\n\\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\\n\\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\\n\\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\\n\\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\\n\\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\\nfirst.\\n\\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\\n\\tI\\'ve repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

One\\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\\nfires....\"  Well, here\\'s some additional insight and some theories\\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\\n\\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\\'t focusing\\non horsepower numbers.\\n\\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\\nbut 4\\'s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\\nSo for 4\\'s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\\n\\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\\nor anything made, just stick \\'em in.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t know about all of this (and I\\'m trying to catch up with\\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\\n4\\'s.        \\n\\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\\nrunning for em), but I don\\'t know why they stopped since then.\\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\\n\\nPeace.\\n\\nWarren\\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\\n\\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\\ndumped ZX-7.

Do the gases really \\n>compress that much?\\n\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

The \\ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \\npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \\nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \\npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \\nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \\nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \\nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \\nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \\nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\\nand translating the image into postscript.\\n\\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \\npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \\nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \\nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \\nsome assurance that the product will work.\\n\\n\\nHere my questions:\\n\\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \\nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\\n\\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \\nthe printer?\\n \\nThe Big question:\\n\\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease email directly to me, I don\\'t not read news on a regular basis. \\nI will post a summary.\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n\\n-- \\n\\tE-mail:\\t\\tscott@ncifcrf.gov ,Phone #:\\t(301) 846-5798\\n        Title:  \\tSr. Systems Manager/Analyst\\n',\n",

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``.
